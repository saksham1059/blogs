    <h1>The Wild Ride of Hacking Pizza Wings: Glitches, Free Pizza & a Job Offer!</h1>
    
    <p>
      So, here's the absurd truth of how I, a self-proclaimed silly cat 😹, ended up hacking Pizza Wings—and inadvertently scoring a job opportunity (yes, you read that right)! Buckle up, because this ride is packed with wild glitches, free pizza 🍕, and more than a few laughs 😂.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Offer That Sparked It All</h2>
    <p>
      It all started when I noticed that the Pizza Wings app had an offer: buy one pizza on Sunday and get two free! (Note: this offer no longer exists—but the date-changing trick still worked like magic.) One fine Wednesday, hunger struck, and I thought, "Why not?" So, I changed my phone’s date to Sunday and bam—offer activated! That’s when I got curious about just how messed up Pizza Wings’ security really was.
    </p>
    
    <h2>A Series of Unbelievable Glitches</h2>
    <p>
      In my mischief mode, I turned off my internet and, to my surprise, an error popped up revealing a leaked backend URL: <code>pizzawings.co.in:3000</code>. If you visited that link (back in the day), it even welcomed hackers like us with a cheeky message. And here’s the kicker: I discovered a glitch where, when offline, you could snag two specific pizzas for absolutely zero rupees 🤯.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Teamwork Makes the Dream Work</h2>
    <p>
      My cousin Aarav dropped by one day and mentioned that you can track HTTP GET and POST requests using the power of "Inspect Element." Intrigued (and a little mischievous), I tried it out and found a way to grab someone's Pizza Wings details by simply sending a GET request to:
    </p>
    <pre>
https://pizzawings.co.in:3000/user/getUserFullDetailById/272
    </pre>
    <p>
      With that, I could extract addresses, OTPs, and more. (Don't worry—they patched it later!)
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Bot That Brought the Feast</h2>
    <p>
      Fueled by excitement, I built a Python bot that scraped every single person’s details (from IDs 1 to 500k) and dumped them into an Excel file. Yes, an Excel file! I even joked that if anyone wanted to buy the data, they should contact me with their price—just kidding (or am I? 😉).
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Job Offer & A Hilarious Meme</h2>
    <p>
      I eventually contacted Pizza Wings about these bugs, but got nothing in return. Then, by some wild twist of fate, I ended up chatting with a Pizza Wings manager. After I spilled the beans on everything, he asked if I wanted to work with them. I said, "Sure—right after my 10th class boards!" 📚 And here's where the universe threw in a little bonus laugh:

    <h2>The Not-So-Free Pizza & Payment Shenanigans</h2>
    <p>
      After my epic free pizza moment (which wasn’t completely free—I ended up paying a measly 3₹ online with no refund), I dived into their payment system and discovered their Razorpay API. I even initiated refunds for myself and helped some desperate Instagram folks who were begging for their money back. Pizza Wings was deleting angry comments, so I stepped in to fix things!

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      This is just 40% of all my findings—trust me, the rest is top secret! Shout out to my buddies for having my back:
