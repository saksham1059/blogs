    <h1>The Wild Ride of Hacking Pizza Wings: Glitches, Free Pizza & a Job Offer!</h1>
    
    <p>
      So, here's the absurd truth of how I, a self-proclaimed silly cat üòπ, ended up hacking Pizza Wings‚Äîand inadvertently scoring a job opportunity (yes, you read that right)! Buckle up, because this ride is packed with wild glitches, free pizza üçï, and more than a few laughs üòÇ.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Offer That Sparked It All</h2>
    <p>
      One day, I noticed on the Pizza Wings app an offer: buy one pizza on Sunday and get two free! (Note: this offer no longer exists‚Äîbut the date-changing trick still works.) Then, on a random Wednesday, I got hungry and thought, "Hey, why not try it?" Being a silly cat, I changed my phone‚Äôs date to Sunday and‚Äîbam!‚Äîthe offer worked like magic.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Curiosity Killed the Security</h2>
    <p>
      That little trick made me wonder: just how messed up is Pizza Wings‚Äô security? So, I went back to their app, turned off my internet, and‚Äîsurprise!‚Äîan error popped up that leaked a backend URL: <code>pizzawings.co.in:3000</code>. If you visit that link (back in the day), it even welcomed hackers like us with a cheeky ‚Äúhack us‚Äù vibe. Oh, and I found a glitch where, when offline, you could snag two specific pizzas for 0‚Çπ. LMAO!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Teamwork Makes the Dream Work</h2>
    <p>
      Then, my cousin <a href="https://aaravmain.org/" target="_blank">aarav</a> dropped by and told me, "You can track HTTP GET and POST requests using the power of Inspect Element." Intrigued (and a little mischievous), I tried it and discovered a way to grab someone's Pizza Wings details. By sending a GET request to:
    </p>
    <pre>
https://pizzawings.co.in:3000/user/getUserFullDetailById/272
    </pre>
    <p>
      I could fetch addresses, OTPs, and a bunch of other info. (Don't worry‚Äîthey patched this glitch later!)
    </p>
    
    <h2>I Found Their Google Maps API Key</h2>
    <p>
      And just when I thought things couldn't get crazier, I found their Google Maps API key still open: <code>AIzaSyDBy_ieIzByu1uYgW1FEaM5vXUW9QeYal4</code>. Anyone can use it! When I told Pizza Wings about this, they were taking it way too easy. This isn‚Äôt just a bug‚Äîit's a full-blown security nightmare, and trust me, it's a little sweet revenge.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Bot That Was Fucking Their Database</h2>
    <p>
      Fueled by excitement, I built a Python bot that scraped every single person‚Äôs details (from IDs 1 to 500k) and dumped them into an Excel file. Yes, an Excel file! I even joked that if anyone wanted to buy the data, they should contact me with their price‚Äîjust kidding (or am I? üòâ).
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Loyalty Points Glitch</h2>
    <p>
      Then came the greatest glitch of all time: loyalty points. Pizza Wings had a reward system where you could only use 25% of your loyalty points. Imagine ordering for 100‚Çπ, having 500 points, but only getting a 25‚Çπ discount! I found a glitch to use all my loyalty points without deducting any, which meant I could get the entire order for free. I ordered 25 pizzas and 10 coldrinks with this glitch‚Äîand even roped in my closest Pizza Wings outlet delivery partner to join me. Epic, right?
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Ban and the Unban</h2>
    <p>
      Naturally, Pizza Wings banned my account... but fuck Pizza Wings‚ÄîI unbanned myself like a boss! üòÇ Then, I started creating a reel so that they‚Äôd get in contact, but nothing happened.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Phone Numbers and the Great Switcheroo</h2>
    <p>
      Next, I thought the Excel file must have the devs‚Äô phone numbers. I fed it to ChatGPT and, lo and behold, got 5-6 phone numbers. I texted them, but only one replied. He claimed he wasn‚Äôt from Pizza Wings. Later, I contacted my delivery partner (who was in my team) and he gave me the phone number of a Pizza Wings manager. After talking to him, the guy who previously said he wasn‚Äôt from Pizza Wings texted me back saying he was actually from there. LMAO!
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Job Offer</h2>
    <p>
      I eventually contacted Pizza Wings about these bugs, but got nothing in return. Then, by some wild twist of fate, I ended up chatting with a Pizza Wings manager. After I spilled the beans on everything, he asked if I wanted to work with them. I said, "Sure‚Äîright after my 10th class boards!" üìö

    <h2>The Not-So-Free Pizza & Payment Mishaps</h2>
    <p>
      After that, I went home and tracked how payments worked. I discovered their Razorpay paywall API and even initiated a refund for myself. I still have their Razorpay API‚Äîand I helped three people from Instagram get refunds when their orders were deducted but never placed. Pizza Wings was deleting their comments and not initiating chargebacks, so I took matters into my own hands and made them happy.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Admin Panel</h2>
    <p>
      By the way, Pizza Wings‚Äô admin panel is at: <a href="https://stgadmin.pizzawings.co.in/#/login" target="_blank">https://stgadmin.pizzawings.co.in/#/login</a>  
      (I don‚Äôt know the login credentials, but if you guys find them, contact me!)
    </p>
    
    <h2>Confidential Findings</h2>
    <p>
      This is literally 40% of my findings‚Äîthe rest are confidential.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Shout out to my buddies for having my back:

      <a href="https://lepichudoes.deno.dev/" target="_blank">lepichu</a> for helping me in my journey coz I am an introvert‚Äîthese guys helped me to say what to reply to them.
